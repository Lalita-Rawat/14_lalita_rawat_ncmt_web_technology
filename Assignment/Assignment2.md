# CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

## Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
### 1. Define the term ”Sitemap” in the planning phase.
**Ans:**
Sitemap is define as  the plan for arranging the content of websites and apps. It is the kind of framework that orients the displayed data.During the planning phase, it helps designers and developers organize content, plan navigation, and ensure users can esaily move through the website.

### 2.	What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?
**Ans:** Launch phase is the last phase of the web development process. Project is launched after getting registered with ISP. after launching, web project is publicly accessed by the users of the particular domain. 

The tasks performed in the launch phase are as follows:

-Migration of data

-Launching of server

-Merging of code

-Redirecting domain name

### 3.	Why is ”Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
**Ans:** Documentation is the description of how the software  shall perform and which environment setup would be appropriate to have the best out of it.  It helps developers understand the code, makes maintenance and future updates easier, and allows new team members to quickly learn the system.
### 4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
**Ans:** The frontend is the part of a website or app users directly interact with. It includes the layour, design and interactive elements, creating a smooth and user-friendly experience.
The backend is the server side of web development. It handles and processes dara, manages storage and retrieval, and ensures the frontend gets the information it needs. 
## Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)
### 5. ”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
**Ans:** Planning is the most critical phase of web development because this is where you shape the site structure, determine what pages are needed and define the paths users will take from entry to conversion.

**Key activities:**

**Requirement Analysis:** Identifying the purpose of the website, targest users, and required features.

**Goal Definition:** Defining clear objectives such as functionality, performance, and user experience goals.

**Content Planning:** Deciding what content(text,images,videos) will be included on each page.

**Sitemap:** A top-level map of the site that outlines the page list and how pages connect. It also accounts for SEO considerations such as crawlable structure and page hierachy, giving the team a shared view of what’s being build.

**Wireframes:** Creating basic layout sketches to plan page structure and elements placement.

**Technology Selection:** Choosing appropriate tools, programming languages, frameworks and databases.

### 6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly ”finished”?
**Ans:** A website is never truly”finished” because the maintenance phase is an iterative and ongoing cycle of monitoring, evaluating, and improving the website even after it has been launched. Instead of happening once maintenance is repeated regularly based on user feedback, technology changes and new requirement.

The iterative nature of Maintenance Phase are done for below reasons:

**Bug Fixing:** Sometime errors discovered by users are identifies and corrected repeatedly.

**Content Updates:** Information, images and  features are updated to kepp the site relevant.

**Performance Improvement:** Speed, security and comatibility are continuously optimized.

**Security Updates:** Regular patches are applied to protect against new threats.
 
A website must adapt to ongoing changes and improvements, the maintenance phase is ongoing and iterative, making a website a contiuously evolving product rather than a one-time project.

### 7. Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
**Ans:** Effective information is a systematic process that involves acquiring, arranging, and evaluating data, facts, and knowledge from diverse sources using sophisticated information gathering tools. The principles that guide this process are simple yet profound. They encompass:

•	Maintaining simplicity in the process

•	Thorough planning

•	Collecting reliable data with stringent quality control

•	Involving pertinent stakeholders

Every piece of data, every fact, and every bit of knowledge collected aids in making well-informed decisions, strategic planning, and conducting comprehensive research.

Why Understanding the Target Audience Is Crucial:

•	Helps design a user-friendly interface suited to users’ age, skills, and needs

•	Ensures content is relevant, clear, and engaging

•	Improves navigation and accessibility

•	Increases user satisfaction and website effectiveness

Understanding the target audience during information gathering ensures the website is designed to meet real user needs, leading to better usability, engagement, and overall success.

## Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
### 8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the "Testing" phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.
**Ans:** As the project manager, I strongly advise not skipping the Testing phase, even if the goal is to save money and launch quickly. Testing is very important for an e-commerce website because users trust it with their personal and payment information.

**Security Risks:** If we skip testing, hidden security problems might go unnoticed. Hackers could steal customer details like passwords or credit card numbers. Even one security issue can harm the company’s reputation and cost much more than testing would.

**Functionality Issues:** Testing makes sure that everything—search, shopping cart, checkout, payments, and order confirmation—works properly. Without it, parts of the website could break, calculations could be wrong, or transactions could fail, which would frustrate customers and make them leave.

**Compatibility Problems:** People use different devices and browsers to visit the website. Without testing, the site may not display or work correctly on some phones, tablets, or browsers. This can lead to a bad user experience and lost customers.

Skipping testing may save some time or money at first, but it puts the website and the business at risk. Testing ensures the site is safe, works well for everyone, and keeps customers happy. It’s not an extra cost—it’s an investment in the website’s success.

### 9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.
**Ans:** The developer started coding the website right after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Because of this, the client rejected the layout midway through the project.

**No plan:** Without a sitemap or prototype, the website had no clear plan. The pages, content, and navigation were not organized, so the developer and the client had different ideas about how the website should look and function.

**Wasted time and effort:** Coding without approval resulted in a lot of rework. It is difficult and time-consuming to fix the layout after coding. This wastes both time and effort and delays the project.

**Poor communication with the client:** The client was not involved in the initial stages, so their expectations were not clear. When the design was shown halfway through, they were dissatisfied because it was not what they had imagined.

**How to do it:**

**Create a sitemap:** Plan all the pages and navigation, so that there is a clear structure.

**Prototyping or wireframing:** Show the client a basic design of layout, text, images, and buttons first.

**Get customer feedback early:** Make improvements based on customer suggestions before you start coding.

It is very important to plan and show the design before you start coding. This saves time, reduces errors, makes the project easier, and keeps the client happy. Starting coding too early without a plan can lead to confusion, wasted time/effort, and a delayed website.

### 10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.
**Ans:** This is the phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the software is updated, fixed, and enhanced after delivery to ensure it continues to meet user needs and remains relevant and functional over time. It's not a one-time event but a continuous process.Activities neglected in this Case are:

**Corrective Maintenance:** Fixing bugs or errors discovered after deployment. While not explicitly about bugs, outdated information is a form of "content error" that needs correction.

**Adaptive Maintenance:** Modifying the system to cope with changes in the environment. In this case, the environment changed (new exam schedules were created), but the website was not adapted.

**Perfective Maintenance:** Improving performance or adding minor enhancements. A simple improvement could have been a system to alert the admin when content is old.

***Content Updates:*** This is the most direct failure. Specific activities that were neglected include:

*Content Review:* No one was assigned to periodically review key information (like exam schedules) for accuracy.

*Update Procedures:* No clear process was established for who (e.g., registrar's office) is responsible for providing new schedules and who (e.g., web admin) is responsible for posting them.

*Version Control for Content:* Managing and tracking changes to the information presented.

**Root Cause and The Missing Link**

-The development team likely treated the project as "complete" upon launch. They neglected the operational plan for keeping the website's content dynamic. A proper maintenance plan would have defined:

•	Owner: Who is responsible for the website's content post-launch?

•	Update Schedule: How often are key sections like "Exam Schedules" reviewed?

•	Workflow: How does new information from academic departments flow onto the website?

•	Monitoring: Checking website analytics and user feedback, which would have shown declining visits due to outdated info.

In short, the team failed to transition from project development to product/service management. The website is not a static artifact but a living information service that requires continuous care to remain useful.
