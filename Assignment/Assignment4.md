# CHAPTER 4: WEBSITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
## Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

### 1. Differentiate between Legibility and Readability.
**Ans:** 
Legibility refers to how easily individual letters and characters can be recognized in a typeface. It depends on the design of the font, such as clear letter shapes and sufficient contrast. Readability, on the other hand, refers to how easily a block of text can be read and understood as a whole. Readability is influenced by factors such as font size, line spacing, paragraph length, and layout. A text may be legible but still difficult to read if it is poorly arranged.

### 2. What is the ”Rule of Thirds” in layout design?
**Ans:** 
The Rule of Thirds is a design principle where a page is divided into three equal horizontal and vertical sections, creating nine parts. Important elements are placed along these lines or at their intersections. This technique helps create visual balance, focus, and a more attractive layout instead of placing everything in the center.

### 3. Why should you limit the number of font families used on a website?
**Ans:** 
Limiting the number of font families on a website helps maintain consistency and professionalism. Using too many fonts makes the design look cluttered and confusing, which reduces readability and user experience. Generally, using two or three complementary fonts is sufficient for a clean and effective design.

### 4. Define ”Responsive Web Design.”
**Ans:** 
Responsive Web Design is an approach in which a website automatically adapts its layout and content to fit different screen sizes and devices. It uses flexible grids, images, and CSS media queries to ensure proper viewing and usability on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

## Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

###  5. Explain the ”F-Pattern” of scanning and how it influences the placement of content on a web page.
**Ans:**
When users visit a website, they usually do not read all the content carefully. Instead, they quickly scan the page to find useful information. Research on user behavior shows that most people scan web pages in an “F” shaped pattern. First, they scan across the top of the page, where headings, logos, and menus are usually placed. Then they move slightly down the page and scan across again. After that, they scan vertically along the left side of the page, looking for keywords or important points.

This scanning habit strongly affects how content should be placed on a website. Important elements such as the website logo, navigation menu, main heading, and key messages should be placed at the top and left side of the page. Long paragraphs placed in the center or right side are often ignored by users. Designers also use sub-headings, bullet points, bold text, and short paragraphs to help users scan content easily.

Designing according to the F-Pattern helps users find information quickly, improves usability, and keeps users engaged. This pattern is especially useful for blogs, news websites, educational sites, and content-heavy pages.

### 6. Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design. Give examples of where Blue, Red, and Green should be used.
**Ans:**
Colors have a strong psychological effect on how users feel and behave on a website. The right color choice can create trust, attract attention, or give a sense of comfort, while wrong colors can confuse or irritate users. That is why understanding color psychology is very important in web design.

Blue is associated with trust, calmness, stability, and professionalism. It makes users feel safe and relaxed. Because of this, blue is commonly used by banks, corporate companies, technology firms, and law offices. It helps build confidence and trust among users.

Red is a powerful and energetic color. It represents urgency, excitement, and action. Red quickly grabs attention, so it is often used for call-to-action buttons like “Buy Now,” warning messages, and sale banners. However, too much red can feel aggressive, so it should be used carefully.

Green represents nature, health, balance, and growth. It is easy on the eyes and creates a calming effect. Green is widely used in healthcare websites, environmental organizations, and financial platforms to show growth and safety.

Using colors correctly helps improve user experience and strengthens the message of a website.

### 7. Explain the ”60-30-10 Rule” regarding color balance on a website.
**Ans:**
The 60-30-10 rule is a simple and effective guideline used to create balanced color combinations in web design. This rule helps designers avoid using too many colors and keeps the design visually pleasing.

According to this rule, 60% of the website should use the main color. This is usually a neutral or soft color used for the background and main layout. It sets the overall look and feel of the website.
30% of the website uses a secondary color. This color is applied to sections, cards, menus, or sidebars to add contrast and structure.
The remaining 10% is the accent color. This color is bold and used for buttons, links, icons, and highlights to attract user attention.

Following the 60-30-10 rule creates harmony, improves readability, and helps guide users toward important actions on the website.

## Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

### 8. A website loads very slowly, causing users to abandon it. Upon inspection, you find the developer used high-resolution raw images directly from a camera. Explain the importance of Image Optimization and file formats (JPEG vs PNG) to solve this.
**Ans:**
Website loading speed is very important for user satisfaction. When a website uses high-resolution raw images directly from a camera, the image file size becomes very large. This increases the loading time of the website, especially on mobile devices or slow internet connections. When users experience slow loading, they often leave the website, which results in poor user experience and lower search engine rankings.

Image optimization is the process of reducing the file size of images without noticeably reducing their quality. This includes resizing images to the correct dimensions, compressing images, and choosing the correct image format. Optimized images load faster, reduce server load, and improve website performance.

JPEG format is best for photographs and colorful images. It uses lossy compression, which reduces file size significantly while keeping acceptable quality. This makes JPEG ideal for banners, background images, and product photos.
PNG format uses lossless compression and supports transparency. It is best for logos, icons, and images with text or sharp edges. However, PNG files are larger and should be used only when necessary.

By optimizing images and choosing the correct format, a website becomes faster, more user-friendly, and more efficient.

###  9. You are designing a website for a Law Firm. The client wants to use a bright yellow background with Comic Sans font to look ”friendly.” As a web designer, critique this choice based on Color Theory and Typography principles, and suggest a better alternative.
**Ans:**
A law firm website should create a feeling of trust, seriousness, and professionalism. Using a bright yellow background and Comic Sans font does not match this requirement. Bright yellow is a very strong color that can cause eye strain and distraction when used as a background. It also does not convey authority or reliability, which are essential qualities for legal services.

Comic Sans is an informal and playful font. It is often used for casual or child-friendly content and does not look professional. Using this font on a law firm website reduces credibility and may cause users to doubt the firm’s seriousness.

A better design choice would be using calm and professional colors such as navy blue, gray, or white. These colors represent trust, stability, and professionalism. Fonts like Times New Roman, Georgia, Roboto, or Open Sans are more suitable because they are easy to read and look formal. This combination creates a professional and trustworthy website while still being user-friendly.

### 10. A website looks great on a laptop but is unreadable on a mobile phone because the user has to zoom in and scroll horizontally. Identify the design principle missing here and explain how Media Queries/Fluid Grids could fix it.
**Ans:**
The main design principle missing in this situation is Responsive Web Design. The website looks good on a laptop but becomes difficult to read on a mobile phone, forcing users to zoom and scroll horizontally. This creates frustration and poor user experience.

Responsive Web Design allows a website to adapt automatically to different screen sizes. Media queries are used to apply different styles based on screen width. They help adjust layout, font size, and spacing for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
Fluid grids use relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixel values. This allows content to resize smoothly according to screen size.

Using media queries and fluid grids together ensures the website remains readable, usable, and visually pleasing on all devices.
